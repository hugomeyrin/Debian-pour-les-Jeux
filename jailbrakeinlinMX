same issue here

        iPad Air A1475
        IOS12.5.5
        checkra1n 0.12.4
        vm ubuntu with AMD based pc
        USB-A original apple cable

I had the same issue with the iPad Air A1474 (A7) with iOS 12.5.5 and found the solution here.
here:
For everyone who doesn't have a Mac machine or can't borrow from friends, I suggest you use ra1nusb instead: https://ra1nusb.thuthuatjb.com/
There are 3 versions and you can try any of them. The basic idea is that it use a MacOS recovery image in USB to create a MacOS environment on non-MacOS machine. This way you can avoid the error which occurs on Linux.

Remember ra1nusb is not really up-to-date with checkra1n (at this moment it supports up to 0.10). You might need to download and copy your specific version to the USB, and execute checkra1n from terminal.

I have tried every checkra1n version on Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Manjaro and they all have the problem at Exploit Failed (Error code: -31). Then I tried ra1nusb and it finally worked.





Try Ra1nUSB_HT to boot in to a macOS environment. I used balenaEtcher to install the dmg file in a 16GB USB drive. checkra1n 0.12.4 beta (enter 124 in Terminal) worked on the first try. I used the Intel version, there is an AMD version too.

Ra1nUSB_HT

Translated from Vietnamese to English with Google Translate. So the grammar may not be standard

    This file Ra1nUSB_HT includes Checkra1n versions from 0.9 to 0.12.4
    Website: jb.tuandb.name.vn
    When there is a new version of Checkra1n and you do not want to recreate the installer, watch Video to manually add the new Checkra1n version.
    Note (Add for video)
        Download the checkra1n file for MacOS on the homepage checkra.in and then open it with 7-Zip to get the checkra1n.app file.
        As for the command file, you copy your existing command file > open with Notepad,... then edit the path accordingly

Ra1nUSB_HT
Request

    USB at least 4GB
    Intel or AMD CPU computer

    Case
        Intel Core I, Xeon, Pentium, Celeron CPUs can all be installed.
        For Pentium and Celeron series will need to FakeCPUID to Core I respectively.

    Laptop and synchronous computer
        CPU Intel Core I

Setting

    Use balenaEtcher or Transmac software to create USB Boot (Using balenaEtcher will be much faster than Transmac)

    Go to BIOS and Disable Secure boot, SATA Mode:AHCI

    Intel version: Fixed when booting Legacy. Priority boot UEFI if the device has

    AMD version: Can only boot UEFI

    UEFI boot has Options and Legacy will not have (Ra1nUSB_HT file, any standard boot will output UEFI)

    UEFI vs Legacy

How to Fix Some Errors (Error title with video link assigned)

    Fix error when clicking Start (The machine does not automatically enter Recovery Mode)

    On your phone go to General > Reset > Reset Privacy and Location > Reconnect phone to PC and click Trust

    If not, you have to manually put the device into Recovery Mode

-How to enter Recovery Mode for those of you who don't know-

a. iPhone 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus

    Plug in the cable to connect to the PC
    Hold down the power and home buttons at the same time until the apple logo appears
    Release the power key but keep holding the home key until the device enters Recovery Mode

b. iPhone 7, 7 Plus

    Plug in the cable to connect to the PC
    Hold the power button and volume down at the same time until the apple logo appears
    Release the power key but keep holding the volume down key until the device enters Recovery Mode

    Error when booting Legacy (for Ra1nUSB_HT version, it is already fixed) Code: 1 , AHCI...

    1

    2

    Error only showing dash when booting

    How to fix:

    Try the methods below with the correct version of Ra1nUSB for the CPU you are using first, and then try again with the version of the other CPU.
        Change the Ram slot if you are plugging in 1 stick. (preferably plugged into slot 1)
        Remove the Ram and try again if there are many bars (preference is given to slot 1)

    If the error persists, do the following:
        Open the BOOT partition of the 200MB USB and then go to the following path BOOT_HT\EFI\ CLOVER\drivers\UEFI and replace file AptioMemoryFix.efi (delete or move the AptioMemoryFix.efi file somewhere else) by file OsxAptioFixDrv.efi or OsxAptioFix2Drv-free2000.efi

Not all machines can be fixed this way. I have been able to fix it with some cases and most of them are due to the error in the Ram slot

- This error will also occur for cases

    Machine configuration not supported
    The config file is not suitable for your device (You must search for the appropriate config file in groups and forums about hackintosh)
    Not calibrated BIOS

Thank you for using
